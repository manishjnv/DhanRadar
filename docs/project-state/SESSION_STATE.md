# DhanRadar — Session State

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06

Living status doc. Update at every session exit (global playbook Phase 6). Keep it short; detail
lives in the linked docs.

## Where we are

- **Phase 1** (infra skeleton, KVM4 shared-infra): **done** — 8-container stack, dedicated
  cloudflared tunnel verified, pushed to `manishjnv/DhanRadar` `main`.
- **Phase 2 slice 1/4** (Auth & Tiering + async Alembic): **built; tests written but NOT yet
  executed** (see `BLOCKERS.md` B1).
- **Stage 1** (contract reconciliation, docs-only): **done** — 6 alignment docs in
  `docs/project-state/`.
- **Stage 2 (Steps 1–9): DONE & merged to `main`** (PRs #2 Steps 2-4, #3 Steps 5-9; baseline
  `05440b1` squashed/scrubbed the history for public release). All steps given a **post-merge
  governance review** 2026-06-05 (`reviews/`): all ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS; one UI **BLOCKER fixed**
  (advisory verbs in `tokens.json`); conditions tracked B7–B12. PC4/PC5 still bind (no KVM4 deploy
  without separate approval).
- **Governance**: project `CLAUDE.md` overlay, `AI_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md` (3-tier review model),
  `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`, `SESSION_STATE.md`, `BLOCKERS.md`, and the rewritten `agent.md`
  landed 2026-06-05.
- **Scoring governance: COMPLETE** — `FINAL_SCORING_SPEC.md` is the consolidated **sole source of
  truth** (ADR-0019). Factor / weight / confidence / risk / label / threshold / governance models
  are **FINAL**; numeric axis weights remain **PROPOSED v1** pending backtest pass-gates + the
  two-person methodology gate (`BLOCKERS.md` B6, non-blocking until production activation). This
  clears `STAGE2_EXECUTION_PLAN` **PC6**.
- **Post-Stage-2 hardening (B13/B10/B9/B3/B4/B11): DONE & merged** via PR #9 (squash `76f7525`),
  CI green. ADR-0020 (concentration). Residuals B15/B16/B17.
- **Phase 3 (Market Data Adapter §B4 + AI/LLM Gateway §B3): DONE & merged** via PR #10 (squash
  `5908a73`), CI green. Providers are stubs; models/prompts injected. Residuals B18–B23.
- **Phase 4 (Rating/Scoring Engine v1 §S): DONE & merged** via PR #11 (squash `033af0e`), CI green.
  Rule-table labels (not score), floor→refuse, 2-eval hysteresis, governance; `activated:false` →
  `provisional_model`. Residuals B24–B28.
- **Phase 5 (Mutual Fund module, CAS→≤60s report): DONE & merged** via PR #12 (squash `ad93d65`),
  CI green. Consent-gated upload (B20, `mf_analytics`) + per-user SHA-256 dedup + <200ms enqueue;
  casparser-injectable parse; XIRR/allocation/overlap; Rating-Engine bridge → `user_fund_scores`;
  disclosure-injected, no-numeric report; 24h raw-file purge; Alembic 0004 mf schema. Residuals
  B26/B29/B30. AMFI NAV pipeline deferred.
- **Phase 6 (Notification: Telegram + Resend email + Pillow share-cards): DONE & merged** via PR #13
  (squash `7f2fc5e`), CI green (incl. the 10 integration tests against Postgres). `notify` schema + Alembic 0005
  (`notification_preferences`/`notification_log`); `publish_notification` LPUSH → Redis channel queues;
  1-min Celery-beat LPOP drain (ADR-0021) with opt-in, IST quiet-hours, per-channel daily rate caps,
  and transient retry (Telegram 3×); Telegram/Resend transports (real UA, Cloudflare-1010 guard, Resend
  not SendGrid); template renderer (label-only, disclosure+NOT_ADVICE+DISCLAIMER_VERSION injected
  structurally, no numeric/advisory); Pillow 1200×630 share-card → R2 (`storage.py`); prefs API +
  `/test` (Pro). 49 unit + 10 integration tests; full deterministic gates green. Tier-A+Compliance
  +Security fan-out: all ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS, no merge BLOCKER; MAJOR/MINORs fixed in-branch (RCA
  2026-06-06); **B31** (cross-border consent, deploy gate) + **B32** (low) filed, **B26** extended.
  Pending: FE preferences screen; daily public Mood card (needs Mood Compass). Ledger:
  `reviews/phase6-notification.md`.
- **Phase 7 (Verification & Hardening): DONE on branch `phase7/verification-hardening`** (Opus
  synthesis; 5 independent auditor agents — 2 Haiku sweeps, 2 Sonnet coverage, 1 Sonnet adversarial
  §5 + 1 Sonnet re-verify). Anti-pattern sweep **CLEAN (9/9)**; constraint audit (secrets/timezone/
  budget PASS; **container memory trimmed 3572M→3072M**; DPDP→B31; audit table→B26); coverage matrix
  (launch-critical path COVERED; "missing" endpoints/events/beat-tasks are unbuilt future-phase
  modules, catalogued not defects); **§5 adversarial gate ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS, no BLOCKER**. Fixed
  in-branch: `RequireConsent` anonymous→**401** safe-by-default (re-verified ACCEPT, RCA 2026-06-06);
  consented_purposes trap annotated. New **B33** (auth/session hygiene, low). Report:
  `PHASE7_VERIFICATION.md`. Merge-eligible; **NOT deploy-eligible** (deploy checklist: B26/B31/B6/B28/
  B18/B2 + live-stack runtime proofs + PC4/PC5 human approval).

## In flight

- **Post-merge governance review of Stage 2 Steps 1–9: DONE** (this session). 6 independent
  reviewer agents across Tier-B (Steps 5-7: RFC7807/migration/billing), Tier-C (Step 8
  ranking_configs), Tier-A (Steps 2-4 frontend) + the earlier Step-1 review. Code found sound — no
  security/compliance leak in code. Trail: `reviews/stage2-step1-openapi.md`,
  `stage2-steps5-7-backend.md`, `stage2-step8-ranking-configs.md`, `stage2-steps2-4-frontend.md`.
- **Fixed this session:** UI BLOCKER — removed the advisory-verb `signal` block from
  `frontend/styles/tokens.json` + regenerated tokens (RCA 2026-06-05); added `_concentration_note`
  to `ranking_configs_v1.json`. **B5 (CI) → RESOLVED**; new blockers **B7–B12** filed.
- **Pre-billing hardening + B12 guard: DONE + reviewed.** B12 (`ci_guards.py` broadened + now scans
  the token files — closes the scope+pattern gaps), B7/B8 (`billing.plans.razorpay_plan_id` /
  `total_count` + migration 0003 + checkout fail-safe), B2 (substring tier foot-gun removed). Tier-B
  review (Architect+Security+Compliance) ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS → 2 MINORs fixed, residuals
  **B13/B14**. Code reached `main` via #6; the governance trail + 2 fixes are on
  `hardening/prebilling-fail-safes`. Trail: `reviews/prebilling-hardening.md`.

## In flight (this session)

- **Phase 4 Rating/Scoring Engine v1 BUILT on branch `phase4/rating-scoring-engine`** (Opus, Tier-C;
  engine `69756e1` + governance fixes; not pushed). Deterministic collapse pipeline (normalize →
  composite → confidence → floor → rule-table label → 2-eval hysteresis → publish), governance
  (churn>5% hold, distribution bound, two-person gate, changelog), internal token-guarded read API.
  Compliance invariants test-enforced: label≠score, no-numeric-public, risk-profile excluded,
  floor→refuse, disclosure/NOT_ADVICE.
- **Tier-C governance fan-out DONE** (Architect/Product Sonnet + Compliance Opus, independent) —
  all ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS, **no BLOCKER**. Fixed in-branch: config completeness validation,
  `provisional_model` tag (activated:false), `disclaimer_version` + `prior_label`, fail-closed
  `X-Internal-Token` guard, neutral factor-agreement on sparse inputs. Residuals **B24–B28**.
  Ledger: `reviews/phase4-rating-scoring-engine.md`. Gates: 133 unit tests; ci_guards 0; compile 0.

## Next action

- **CI regression guards wired (DONE):** `scripts/anti_pattern_sweep.py` (Plan §0.3, 9 guards) +
  `scripts/check_compose_memory.py` (§A6 ≤3072M) now run in the CI `guards` job, with a subprocess
  self-test (`backend/tests/unit/test_anti_pattern_sweep.py`). Closes the Phase-7 improvement suggestion
  — these regressions are caught automatically now.
- **B26 Compliance Audit module: DONE (ADDRESSED)** — `compliance` schema + Alembic 0006
  (partitioned 7-yr `ai_recommendation_audit` + DEFAULT partition + guarded pg_partman; seeded
  `disclaimers`); fire-and-forget `record_served_label`; both live seams write `(label, model,
  disclaimer_version)` (MF generation + notification deliver); served surfaces stamp the version;
  allowlisted `recommendation_type`; public rate-limited `GET /disclaimers/{type}`; daily R2 archival;
  ADR-0022. Tier-B governance ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS (allowlist/version-stamp/endpoint-DoS/backdating
  fixed in-branch). New **B34** (archival R2 residency, deploy gate). Ledger
  `reviews/b26-compliance-audit.md`; feature doc `features/compliance-audit.md`.
- **Mood Compass module: DONE** — `mood` schema + Alembic 0007; pure compute (11 weights, 5 buckets,
  confidence floor → `insufficient_data` <0.30, factors); twice-daily Celery beat (09:00/16:00 IST);
  anon endpoints (`/market/mood`, `/mood/history`, `/why-today`) — **regime + band, no numeric** (non-neg
  #2, ADR-0023); `mood.snapshot.published` = B26 audit (`mood_regime`) + public card via the Notification
  interface (`post_public_card`). Tier-C governance (Architect+Compliance+Product) ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS;
  sub-0.30 refuse + bucket-gap + commentary-screen fixed in-branch. Go-live gaps → **B35** (real signals,
  embed widget, empty-state, factor labels, structured event, mood_history, commentary). Ledger
  `reviews/mood-compass.md`; feature `features/mood-compass.md`.
- **UI is next** (operator-chosen sequence): launch screens against the now-frozen contracts (MF report +
  CAS upload → disclosure rendering → notification prefs → Mood page). Recommended as a fresh session.
- Then continue the build order: **Mood Compass** (unblocks the daily public Mood card + notification
  event consumers), then **Stock/Search**; OR close the MF data pipeline (**B29**: AMFI NAV + scheme
  metadata) so reports return real labels instead of `insufficient_data`.
- Other deploy gates before KVM4: **B31** (notification cross-border consent), **B6/B28** (scoring
  activation), **B18** (atomic AI budget), **B2/B7/B8** (Razorpay data-seeding) + the live-stack
  runtime proofs + separate human approval (PC4/PC5).
- Before MF DEPLOY: **B26** `ai_recommendation_audit` write at the report serve seam; **B29** NAV
  pipeline; **B6/B28** scoring activation gates.

## Open blockers

See `BLOCKERS.md`. Open (low/residual/non-blocking/deploy-gated): B6, B14, B16–B24, B27–B35
(**B26 now ADDRESSED**). New: **B34** (compliance R2 archival residency, deploy gate), **B35**
(Mood Compass go-live: real signals + embed widget + product polish).
Resolved: B5 (CI), **B10**, **B11** (ADR-0020), **B13**. Addressed (code/tests; data-only or
later-module work remains): B1, B2, B3, B4, B7, B8, B9, B12, B25. New: **B31** (notification
cross-border consent, deploy gate), **B32** (notification residuals, low), **B33** (auth/session
hygiene from the Phase-7 §5 gate, low).

## Agent-utilization & routing-telemetry footer

Footer below is the current Phase-7 (Verification & Hardening) work on branch
`phase7/verification-hardening`.

- **Phase 7 footer:** Opus — orchestration + synthesis of all five audits + remediation (RequireConsent
  401, compose memory trim, doc de-stale) + the verification report + all docs. Sonnet — 2 coverage-matrix
  auditors + the §5 adversarial gate + the independent re-verify of the security fix. Haiku — 2 mechanical
  sweeps (anti-pattern §0.3, constraint/DPDP). codex:rescue — n/a (§5 adversarial gate run as independent
  Sonnet per the approved fallback ladder; verdict ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS, no BLOCKER).
- Per-delegation (telemetry): anti-pattern-sweep · Haiku · reworked N (CLEAN 9/9) | constraint-audit ·
  Haiku · reworked N (caught the 3572M memory overage) | coverage-A/B · Sonnet×2 · reworked N | §5-adversarial
  · Sonnet · reworked N (3 MAJOR, no BLOCKER) | consent-401-reverify · Sonnet · ACCEPT.
- Verification note: 212 backend unit tests pass locally + ci_guards 0 + F-lint 0 + markdownlint 0;
  compose YAML valid + memory sum = 3072M; integration suite collects (63) and runs in CI (B1). Live-stack
  hops (E2E, NTP, R2 archival, measured box memory) are deploy-time — listed in the deploy checklist.
